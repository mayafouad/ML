# Machine Learning 🤖✨
#### A simple repository that implements Machine Learning Concepts to solve problems!

## 🏷️ Supervised Learning:
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models that can make predictions.

### 📈 Geometric Models:
Represent data as points in a multi-dimensional space, using geometric concepts like distance, lines, or planes to make predictions and understand relationships. 

#### 1. Simple Linear Regression
#### 2. Multiple Linear Regression
#### 3. Polynomial Regression
#### 4. KNN (classification)

### 🎲 Probabilistic Models:
Represent and analyze uncertainty within data by leveraging probability distributions.

   #### 1. Logistic Regression (classification)
