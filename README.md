## 🏷️ [Supervised Learning:](https://github.com/mayafouad/ML/tree/main/Supervised)
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models that can make predictions.
#
### 📈 Geometric Models:
Represent data as points in a multi-dimensional space, using geometric concepts like distance, lines, or planes to make predictions and understand relationships.
