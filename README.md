# Machine Learning 🤖✨
#### A simple repository that implements Machine Learning Concepts to solve problems!

## 🏷️ Supervised Learning:
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models that can make predictions.

### 🧩 Problems:
 #### 1. Simple Linear Regression
    Suppose you’re the CEO of a big company considering different cities for a new store 🏪.
    You already have data for existing cities — population vs profit.
    Use Linear Regression to predict profit for a new city based on its population.

 #### 2. Multiple Linear Regression
    Predict house prices 🏠 using multiple factors — like size, number of rooms, and airconditioning.

#### 3. Polynomial Regression
     Predict the number of ice cream units 🍦 sold based on temperature.
