# Machine Learning 🤖✨
#### A simple repository that implements Machine Learning Concepts to solve problems!

## 🏷️ Supervised Learning:
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models that can make predictions.

### 📈 Geometric Models:
Represent data as points in a multi-dimensional space, using geometric concepts like distance, lines, or planes to make predictions and understand relationships. 

   #### 1. Simple Linear Regression
      Suppose you’re the CEO of a big company considering different cities for a new store 🏪.
      You already have data for existing cities — population vs profit.
      Use Linear Regression to predict profit for a new city based on its population.
  
   #### 2. Multiple Linear Regression
      Predict house prices 🏠 using multiple factors:
      area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, mainroad, guestroom, basement, hotwaterheating, airconditioning, parking, prefarea,furnishingstatus.
  
  #### 3. Polynomial Regression
       Predict the number of ice cream units 🍦 sold based on temperature.
  
  #### 4. KNN (classification)

### 🎲 Probabilistic Models:
Represent and analyze uncertainty within data by leveraging probability distributions.

   #### 1. Logistic Regression (classification)
