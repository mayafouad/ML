Suppose you are the owner of a shop and you have some basic data about 
your customers like customer ID, age, gender, occupation, etc. You want to 
perform customer segmentation (subdivision of a market into discrete 
customer groups that share similar characteristics) using this data. 
The dataset can be downloaded from:  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dev0914sharma/customer-clustering/data 
Given this data, you are required to cluster customers. Perform the following 
steps: 
➢ Preprocess the data 
➢ Use k-means clustering with different k values (2, 3, 4)  
➢ Use agglomerative clustering and plot the dendrogram 
➢ Compare the time of k-means and agglomerative clustering on this data
